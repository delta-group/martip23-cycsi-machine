##############################

..  include::   /references.inc

Cycsi is a *single Cycle Processor* designed to be used as a tempalte in
COSC2325 - *COmputer Architecture and MachineLanguage* At |ACC|. The
code described here is arrange using a project organiztion pattern I
recomment to my students. This project is incomplete on purpose.
Students are supposed to complete this project as part of the course.

    *Cycsi* is derived from "Single Cycle" using a scheme some believe
