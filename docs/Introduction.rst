COSC2325_ - *Computer Architecture and Machine Language* is designed to
introduce students to the basics of computer system design and the
language that powers the hardware level of their systems. Most students
take this course after one or two programming language courses. The
project uses C++, and basic components of the machine are modeled as C++
classes.  Most of these students have never seen assemly language code,
and designing their own machine walks them through how individual
instructions are selected, then how those instructions are combined to
produce actions that implement their high-level language constructs.

Cycsi is a starting example for my students at
|ACC|. The code presented here is
incomplete, and serves as a guide for students who will create their own
versions of this project.
